hey all.  my little oven died a couple days ago, so i opened it up to see if i could work out why.  seems the timer switch wasn't working.  i took the switch out, there is something rattling around inside it and it's gone.  i then  just taped the two contacts together, and the oven works.  bottom left of second and last pics.

to me logically there is no magic going on in the switch, it's just a spring-loaded timer which mechanically moves the contacts together when it pings off.  i am looking at how easy it is to get a new switch.  not easy, so far.  there are other on/off switches controlling the hot plates and oven functions which work fine.

aside from the obvious bad safety of the oven not having a timed 'off', which i am wondering how to sort out, is there anything in the wiring simply bypassing the timed switch that is an issue?  i'm thinking that there is a risk of the contacts coming clear and touching the frame of the oven.  is there a way to steady them safely?

I'm going to buy a hard case for it, one that will lessen any moisture getting in there and doing bad stuff while its not in use. Also, when cleaning the outer metal, what kind of oil would I use to preserve the finish on the metal?

* The atmoshpere in this game is incredible.  A mature and truthful look at what would happen to a bunch of schoolkids if they were thrust into a war.  Excellent music and pretty good voice acting!  The visuals look like a remastered PSP game, but I knew that going into it and it really doesn't bother me that much.

* Combat is satisfying (on most characters, anyway) and fun.  I love how everyone plays completely differently and they can combo together so well.  Replaying missions is surprisingly fun when I have 20 minutes to spare.


**Cons:**

* The mission/free time structure is my biggest gripe.  I understand what they were trying to achieve, how there's limited time between classes/missions and you can only do so much... but I can spend 100 hours out grinding dungeons and come back to Academia and the battles will wait for me?  ok... 

* I wish I didn't /have/ to play through the game at least 3 times to get the full lore and backstory.  I wish I could open up all the expert trials and missions on one playthrough!

In theory, you could just eat more carbs each day during the diet and you wouldn't need to refeed, but that might not be as fun as eating 400-1000g carbs in 1 day. How many hours per day do you exercise (on average) and how many grams of carbs per day do you eat when you are cutting?

Will the Minister pay particular attention to one group of people—the sons and daughters of Gurkha soldiers ? Last year , Gurkha soldiers were given equal status to British soldiers in every respect—pay and conditions , home leave and so forth—save for the fact that their children are not yet given home - student status . I understand that the Department is working on this matter with the Ministry of Defence . Will the Minister commit himself to giving home - student status to Gurkha soldiers ' children , and will he tell us how the negotiations with the Ministry of Defence are progressing ?","This is extremely important , although it is necessary to put it into context . We have some of the lowest drop - out rates in the advanced world . The recent Public Accounts Committee report included two tables . If we look at the one that includes both those students who transfer to another university and those who achieve a different higher education qualification , we get a more realistic picture . It shows that non - completion rates have reduced consistently since 1998 .",Q,4.0,Flight,Q,3.0,Flight,Q,4.0,Flight,3.6666666666666665,Flight

I am glad to say that , since the film was shot , a start has been made on regenerating that area . Will my right hon Friend join me in congratulating all the people in the area who are working to make it a better place to live ? Incidentally , there was a swing to Labour in the local elections there last Thursday . Does my right hon Friend agree that that is precisely the kind of estate that could benefit from new deal for community funding ?","I think that the hon Lady has mixed up several schemes . We are considering the new deal for communities , whereas she referred to the new deal on unemployment . The scheme that she mentions is working . As we promised , we are getting more and more people back to work , and there has been a 70 per cent . reduction in youth unemployment ; that is an important achievement . The hon Lady also mentioned farming and Rover . We shall hear a statement on the latter shortly . I simply point out that the previous Government sold Rover for £ 1 and left us with all the problems .",Q,3.0,Fight,Q,2.0,,Q,3.0,Fight,2.6666666666666665,Fight
