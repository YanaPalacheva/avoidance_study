## Question Avoidance Study

This is a final project for "Question Processing" course at Uni Potsdam. The contributors are three Master's students:
Iana Palacheva (YanaPalacheva), Polina Gusenkova (PolinaGusenkova) and Karina Hensel (karina-hensel).

This project is dedicated to the phenomenon of question avoidance. 

Our contributions:
- we adapted a fight-or-flight response idea to a classification of question avoidance situations and developed the [annotation guidelines](https://github.com/YanaPalacheva/avoidance_study/blob/master/Annotation/Annotation%20Guidelines%20(1)%20QP.docx).
- we constructed a dataset using question-response pairs from datasets of different domains and manually annotated it (**Annotation** folder).
- we conducted several experiments aimed at discovering underlying lexico-syntactic features of question avoidance (**Experiments** folder).
- we transformed our annotated dataset into a [ConvoKit](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit)-style corpus and augmented it with our findings (**Corpora** folder and [notebook](https://github.com/YanaPalacheva/avoidance_study/blob/master/corpus_creation.ipynb)).

All the results can be found in our [report](https://github.com/YanaPalacheva/avoidance_study/blob/master/question_avoidance_study.pdf).
