Of course , it is difficult at the moment\u2014our troops are facing an immensely challenging and difficult time , as are the American troops up in Baghdad . The fact is , however , that they are now working with Iraqi security forces , which , in many cases , are taking the lead\u2014three of the four provinces in the south are now in Iraqi hands\u2014in standing up to those , often linked to outside groups , who are trying to destroy the country . When such carnage is being visited on the country through terrorism , the last thing we should do is get out . Instead , we should stay until the job is done , and the best people to judge that are the Iraqis themselves .
