hey all.  my little oven died a couple days ago, so i opened it up to see if i could work out why.  seems the timer switch wasn't working.  i took the switch out, there is something rattling around inside it and it's gone.  i then  just taped the two contacts together, and the oven works.  bottom left of second and last pics.

to me logically there is no magic going on in the switch, it's just a spring-loaded timer which mechanically moves the contacts together when it pings off.  i am looking at how easy it is to get a new switch.  not easy, so far.  there are other on/off switches controlling the hot plates and oven functions which work fine.

aside from the obvious bad safety of the oven not having a timed 'off', which i am wondering how to sort out, is there anything in the wiring simply bypassing the timed switch that is an issue?  i'm thinking that there is a risk of the contacts coming clear and touching the frame of the oven.  is there a way to steady them safely?

many thanks.

I'm drawing a blank as to what engine part that could be. The thing about engines is that every piece in it is needed, so in theory if there was a piece that came lose, your bike's engine would be in bad shape, or something wouldn't be working correctly. 

I'm taking a guess here, but it could be something that was accidentally left in the engine the last time the case was open, or maybe it's been in there since the day it was built in the factory.

The visuals look like a remastered PSP game, but I knew that going into it and it really doesn't bother me that much.

* Combat is satisfying (on most characters, anyway) and fun.  I love how everyone plays completely differently and they can combo together so well.  Replaying missions is surprisingly fun when I have 20 minutes to spare.


**Cons:**

* The mission/free time structure is my biggest gripe.  I understand what they were trying to achieve, how there's limited time between classes/missions and you can only do so much... but I can spend 100 hours out grinding dungeons and come back to Academia and the battles will wait for me?  ok... 

* I wish I didn't /have/ to play through the game at least 3 times to get the full lore and backstory.  I wish I could open up all the expert trials and missions on one playthrough!
